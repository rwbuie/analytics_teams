# Purpose and expected outcomes

To create a generalized description of the work of analytics teams in population health and clinical environments.  Such work is expected to lead to improved models and practices for the structure and management of analytics teams in population health and clinical care organizations. 

This study is part of a dissertation in Biomedical and Health Informatics at The University of Washington. It is overseen by a dissertation committee, chaired by Annie T. Chen, faculty in the department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education.

# Design

Researcher(s) will collect descriptions and materials related to the work, deliverables, tools, and upstream and downstream stakeholders of analytics teams in population health and healthcare organizations. This information will be analyzed to develop a model(s) of analytics practice in these environments. 
We seek contributions from managers and direct contributors of analytics teams operating in healthcare and population health spheres.

Approved by University of Washington IRB: STUDY00015689
