The following checklist is designed to help identify people and organizations who are appropriate fits for the study.

If interested in participating, please review the below checklist to see if you may be a good fit.

1. Are there one of more members of your team who would be comfortable with participating in formal research and able to contribute 2-5 hours to participating in research activities?

2. Are there one or more projects or operations that you are willing to share details about in the contexts of academic research (note that participants are free to redact information in part, or whole, from their research record, and that researchers will not publish non-generalized information without participant consent)?

3. Do the above project(s) or operation(s) serve stakeholders engaged in population health, or the delivery of health or social services?

4. Are these stakeholders operating in the state of Washington or serving residents of Washington or Washington based organizations?

If your answers to all of the above questions are “yes”, then your team is likely to be a good fit for the study. If you are interested in learning more or participating, please [reach out] and we can arrange a follow up meeting to provide additional information and discuss next steps.
